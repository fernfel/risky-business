Python 2.7 on OS X 10.6 doesn't install with a working version of Tkinter (32 vs 64 bit issue).
-Problem solved by upgrading to python 2.7.1 with comes with working Tkinter version 8.5.

In python 3.X, ttk is part of Tkinter meaning that import statements must be changed to 
"from tkinter import ttk". Notice also, that for this python version, tkinter is lowercase.

Is there a good way to make an executable to include all of these dependencies?
